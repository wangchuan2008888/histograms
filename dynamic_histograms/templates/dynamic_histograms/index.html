					My name is Steffani Gomez. I am currently a senior at <a href="https://www.brown.edu/" target="_blank">Brown University</a>, pursuing a Sc.B. in Computer Science. My interests in computer science vary (who doesn't like coding?!), but my bookshelf would say my main interests are in data visualization, data science (especially databases), web development, operating systems, algorithms, and a bit of software engineering. I have experience deploying web applications in Java (using Spark) and Python (using Django and Flask), a bit of experience using <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API" target="_blank">canvas</a> and <a href="https://d3js.org/" target="_blank">d3</a> to visualize data, and semesters-worth of classes in software engineering, algorithms, and operating systems. Despite all this, I'm only a humble beginner eager to learn more. If you have any suggestions, critiques, comments, compliments, or cool facts, please feel free to leave them in the message box below.
